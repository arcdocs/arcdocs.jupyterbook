# Advanced Job Examples

## Submitting Mixed Mode Jobs
The ‘mixed mode’ (MPI+OpenMP) programming model typically involves MPI processes running across nodes and OpenMP threads upon each node with the total number of processes (MPI*OpenMP) equalling the number of physical processor cores.

Your code will need to call MPI_Init and make use of OpenMP directives. You will compile your code using an MPI wrapper and enabling OpenMP support, for example:

```bash
$ mpif90 -openmp example.f90 -o mixed.exe
```

You will need to determine `ppn`, the number of MPI processes per node, and `tpp`, the number of OpenMP threads per MPI process.

Additionally, you can either ask for a given number of nodes nodes or for the total number of MPI processes `np`. Note that `ppn` is related to `np` since `ppn` = `np`/nodes.

Your submission script would then need to contain:

```bash
#$ -V 
#$ -l hr_t=01:00:00 
#$ -l nodes=<nodes>, ppn=<ppn>, tpp=<tpp>
mpirun ./a.out
```
or

```bash
#$ -V
#$ -l hr_t=01:00:00 
#$ -l np=<np>, ppn=<ppn>, tpp=<tpp> 
mpirun ./a.out
```
There are 24 cores per node on ARC3 , so you would typically ensure `ppn`\*`tpp`=24.    
There are 40 cores per node on ARC4 , so you would typically ensure `ppn`\*`tpp`=40.

### Example
Using ARC4, To run an MPI+OpenMP executable mixed.exe with 80 MPI processes each launching 4 OpenMP threads, the following submission script would be needed:
```bash
#$ -V 
#$ -cwd
#$ -l hr_t=01:00:00 
#$ -l np=80, ppn=10, tpp=4 
mpirun ./mixed.exe
```
This will allocate 8 nodes (=8*40=320 cores).
Each node will have 10 MPI processes, each of which will have 4 OpenMP threads (so 10\*4=40 processes per node in total, and 8\*140=320 (=80MPI\*4OpenMP) processes in total.

Alternatively, the same effect can be achieved by:
```bash
#$ -V 
#$ -cwd
#$ -l hr_t=01:00:00 
#$ -l nodes=8, ppn=10, tpp=4 
mpirun ./mixed.exe
```
Note that the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable is automatically set by the batch system and so you do not need to set this in your environment.

## Job Dependencies
The SGE scheduler allows you to submit a job but then hold them in the queue until certain job dependencies are met, ie. it will hold the job until a previous job (or number of jobs have completed).

To do this, submit the first job as normal:

```bash
$ qsub job1.sh
```

As usual, the scheduler will give you a job ID `<jobid>`.

if you then want to submit another job that is dependent on the first one completing, use the `-hold_jid` option for qsub:

```bash
$ qsub -hold_jid <jobid> job2.sh
```

Job 2 will remain in the queue until job 1 has completed.

Alternatively, if you have given the job a name (using the `-N` option), then you can put a hold on subsequent jobs using the name instead:

```bash
$ qsub -hold_jid <jobname> job2.sh
```

If you give several jobs the same name, then the job will be held until all the named jobs have been completed.
